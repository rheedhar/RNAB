# RNAB (*REE Needs A Budget*)


## Introduction
***RNAB***  is a personal budget app that helps you to create a personal budget, manage, and track your finances. 
I created this app to address some of the challenges and frustrations I had with using the popular *YNAB(You Need A Budget)* budgeting app. 
This was also a fun way for me to practice my java and web development skills.

spending category or change the target amount for a specific month's plan without it affecting future months
